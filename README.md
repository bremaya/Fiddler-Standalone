# Fiddler Standalone

Web Debugging Utility. Fiddler Classic is the Original and Free Web Debugging Proxy Tool Exclusively for Windows. The community-trusted free Windows-only tool that logs HTTP(s) network (internet) traffic.


This is a personal project, and I'm not related with Fiddler (https://www.telerik.com/fiddler/fiddler-classic), Telerik (https://www.telerik.com) or PortableApps (https://portableapps.com).
Only unpack and enjoy (unpack in PortableApps folder to integrate with him).

This is packed with Fiddler Classic v5.0.20211.51073.
